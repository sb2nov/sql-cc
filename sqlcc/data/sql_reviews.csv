The description and pictures are accurate and communication was always prompt. The flat is only a studio space, but the kitchen is fully equipped, as is the bathroom/laundry. <br/>There was torrential rain for most of our holiday, which limited our access to the balcony and the expansive rooftop common space, with its ocean views to Clovelly. <br/>Still, we were snug and comfortable and didn't want for anything in the unit itself. It is at the back of the block and quiet, but close to cafes convenience stores and transport. <br/>We would be happy to return there, and to recommend it to others."

20628052,199418949,2017-10-01T00:00:00Z,477117,Cristina,"Claire’s place was a wonderful place to base ourselves over a long weekend. The apartment is private with a great courtyard, which was really handy to dry towels and beach gear since it’s walking distance to the beach! The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was equipped with everything we needed. Claire was an incredibly hospitable host, helpful, and always quick to respond to any questions we had. We could not have found a better spot! Thank you so much Claire and Greta!"

45917438,740457275,2021-03-19T00:00:00Z,244819366,Matthew,Great location and incredibly tidy apartment. Only thing which would be nice is a higher water pressure in the shower.

It met all our expectations and in a great location to where we needed to go. <br/>The house is modern and has everything you need to feel like you're at home. Would definitely recommend to stay here and we look forward to staying here again in the future."

22311178,403447749,2019-01-20T00:00:00Z,95847955,Joel,"Ken and his wife responded very quickly to any messages before our stay and with requests we made after arrival, yet we only ever saw and heard them when we needed them. And we got to experience life in Cabramatta, which is a part of Sydney not many ""tourists"" get to visit."

Short bus trip to city. Marcela helps me when i have questions about activities in Sydney.<br/>Thank you for the nice time.

Large kitchen with missing knobs off drawers and badly aligned cupboards . We had trouble with TV which was eventually fixed.<br/>Main bedroom large and comfortable."
33757329,756278589,2021-05-08T00:00:00Z,381633253,Zoe,"Very clean and such great interiors. Perfect location - very close to Kings Cross station, the best if you're looking to spend some time in Sydney city."

22973428,271969506,2018-06-02T00:00:00Z,187293725,Danarenae,"Sian's home was absolutely perfect for our vacation in Sydney! The location is perfect to check out the beaches and easy to hop on the train to the city center. We had a bit of hiccup in our plans and needed to come early, Sian worked with us to make it hassle -free. The home was clean and exactly as advertised. Thanks for hosting us!"
22311178,497885810,2019-07-29T00:00:00Z,154920294,Ted,"Really enjoyed our stay here! The place was so much nicer than we expected. It was very spacious for three people, with excellent cooking utilities for breakfast, lunch and dinners!"
37999560,748602333,2021-04-14T00:00:00Z,115621876,Sharyn,"Derek's place is in a great location, very close to great cafes and restaurants and close to public transport. It is a beautiful old house with stained glass windows, but does need a bit of love and attention, with quite a few broken items. There was a very bad damp smell and leak in the kitchen that we needed to notify Derek about and after a couple of days a plumber came and fixed it, leaving a gap in the kickboard which hopefully has now been fixed. Very basic kitchen supplies, but if you aren't planning on eating in then not a problem. Also no hairdryer although listed in the amenities, so bring your own! The kids did enjoy the pool and the spa bath."
22311178,329009593,2018-09-27T00:00:00Z,59531996,Daiyanti,Great place
45917438,708106269,2020-11-11T00:00:00Z,22739327,Gemma,"Stephanie and Peter's place was great. Communication was super quick and responsive, easy access and exactly as described. They had provided little touches throughout which were so convenient such as powerboards, stationary, milk, tea, and more! Made it so easy to walk in and settle down.<br/><br/>Having lived in Darlinghurst for many years the location was perfect - close access to everything. It is close to a main road so there is a little road noise during the day which only affected me on the days I was working from the apartment, however you can close the windows and turn the AC on (extra bonus!) and it's much less noticeable. <br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend their place to stay! Thanks for a great stay."
22311178,247257977,2018-03-27T00:00:00Z,162959434,Nick And Claire,"While we only had a quick stay at Ken’s place, it suited us for what we needed. <br/>Would also be perfect for longer stays, as offers a great kitchen with stove/oven as well as washing machine. <br/>Great communication on Ken’s part as well made our stay easy and stress free."
48699778,519056057023381820,2021-12-16T00:00:00Z,163041986,Skye,Loved this place. Great quiet spot in Bronte but with a bunch of good cafes and restaurants downstairs. Wifi was great - I was working with lots of zoom calls and it worked perfectly. Great little patio. Host was really helpful and responsive.

I enjoy the proximity to local amenities and various food choices. Alzbeta has been great with communication and a pleasure to meet in person. This is one great little studio that I would stay again. Many thanks!"

20628052,611734252,2020-02-27T00:00:00Z,303224355,Monique,"This airbnb location is the best! It's cosy and stylish at the same time. It's well located near the ocean, the warf and the center of Manly. And still quiet, I slept very well here. The garden is great, breakfast in the sun.. I enjoyed staying here a lot. Claire and Greta were great hosts, very helpfull."
20628052,606942244,2020-02-16T00:00:00Z,30678477,Belinda,"Fabulous place to stay whilst visiting Manly. A home away from home with cooking facilities, washing machine, clothes line and very comfortable queen bed. The starting food items left for us were very much appreciated. Manly is a fabulous place to visit and Claire’s home located in a lovely neighbourhood topped off our experience."
41983356,676410434982142182,2022-07-22T00:00:00Z,52451504,Juliet,Fabulous as always. Thanks Mark!
22311178,277233656,2018-06-16T00:00:00Z,12040953,Micaela,"Great find for an affordable one night stay! Two bedrooms were the perfect space for us and our two year old son. Kitchen facilities were also very useful. Booking, check in and check out were all simple. Handy spot, tucked away in a quiet street, with food and convenience options only a short walk away."
33757329,611132122436078163,2022-04-23T00:00:00Z,452171120,Emilyanne,"It was a nice place to stay the room was clean and the shared bathrooms were kept a lot nicer than other shared washrooms. The location was pretty good as it is near grocery stores and Kings Cross. However, I would suggest going elsewhere (outside of Potts Point) for food as the food is overpriced and not that good. Also, be careful going out at night as Potts Point becomes a lot more sketchy. Overall I definitely recommend staying at the Jensen."
33757329,730269500,2021-02-10T00:00:00Z,117811210,Dong Lin,"Good location, great cleanliness, excellent service and communication. Highly recommended!"
9376988,589400048,2020-01-05T00:00:00Z,227180362,Natalie,Emma's place was a great sized family home. The outdoor area with the pool was great! The location was a walk to North Avalon beach and a 15 min walk to the main Avalon village. We all had a great stay! Thank you Emma!
45917438,566845058032407553,2022-02-20T00:00:00Z,72156127,Nicholas,"Great place. Stocked with everything you can think of needing. Stephanie and Peter were quick and helpful. Wifi was poor. At most got 10 Mbps, usually 5 or less. Would have been ok if it hadn't cut out completely from time to time as well."
22311178,448185587,2019-05-05T00:00:00Z,233538724,Steven,"The host Ken was great to communicate with, answered my queries promptly.  The location was equi-distance to the two places I was interested in (about 7-9 minutes driving), they being Liverpool and Cabramatta, so that was perfect for me.  It was also good to be able to park my car on-site rather than on the kerb."

The apartment is in the perfect location, it in a quiet street yet only a short walk to the beach and shops. It is everything you'd need for a short or lengthy stay. Would recommend."

22311178,616177711,2020-03-09T00:00:00Z,150689302,Symantha,"Very quick to respond, great place to stay. Friendly environment especially with our 21month old son. Clean beddings and towels. Ken even extended one more night for us on the spot when we requested. <br/>My only feedback would be breakfast isn’t really breakfast, it’s packets of snacks. <br/>We had to buy our own breakfast each day. Otherwise, excellent service and stay."
33757329,761200610,2021-05-23T00:00:00Z,137596909,Daniel,great stay!
37999560,756307138,2021-05-09T00:00:00Z,67997216,Lauren,"This is a roomy place and an easy stroll to Haberfield's village with its Italian providores and some great restaurants, including the Insta-famous Happyfield.  For us, it turned out not to be a great choice, however if you are not going to be cooking, have a dog small enough not to jump out or be let out in error onto a busy road, and don't need a lot of privacy it could be comfortable.  Seemingly lots of others have been.  As the previous reviewer mentioned, it is in need of some TLC to be safe and equipped as expected, and as per the last reviewer, the owner did fix a few problems but this all took quite a while and a lot of liasing on my part.  In the end I felt they were annoyed when I reported errant wiring in the cooker and a gas leak - the owner is a very busy man but I too have better things to do.  The dishwasher has still not been properly fixed, still no hairdryer, a nine day wait for the oven to be cleaned and usable.  TV is very old, no catch-up or Netflix if you are staying a while as we were.  Owner apologised for the lack of the advertised work desk I needed and after a while supplied one, filthy from being outside, literally dripping in cobwebs and which was excellent after I spent an hour cleaning it and killing the 27 spiders (I counted...) that had made it home.  Just to give you the gist.  We feel safer and happier in our new AirBnB."

16411678,419827042,2019-03-04T00:00:00Z,9038036,Ali,"We had the perfect stay at Alzbeta’s house, extremely comfortable and really good location. The house is small but so luminous, beautiful and functional - it was more than enough for 2 people for a week. We had everything from shampoos to hangers, abundance of towels, kitchen supplies etc. The bed was comfortable and the house was spotless clean. Alzbeta was responsive, she let us early check in and introduced us around, she was super sweet. The location is perfect; quiet, safe, so many restaurants and cafes around, really close to metro station and a close uber ride to almost everywhere (like the opera house or bondi beach). We’d definitely stay at her place again and I’d recommend to everyone."

It is up one marble flight, which was no problem. The wall of glass louvres gave good cross breeze. The contemporary kitchen had absolutely everything we needed. We enjoyed barbecues up on the roof with views to the harbour bridge.<br/>Mark and Jennifer were thoughtful hosts, friendly and quick to respond to queries, and very informative about the area. We highly recommend Duffotel for a Paddington stay."
