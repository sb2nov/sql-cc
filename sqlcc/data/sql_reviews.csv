Nice and close to a good Italian restaurant as well. The owner went out his way to get the unit ready for us after a black out neatly delayed our check in.  The unit has has everything you need, but a few extras such as bath mats, tissues, milk etc would have been good.  Batteries in the remotes probably need replacing as well.  Would  certainly stay here again."

Nice and quiet but close to shops and entertainment. Only advise would be to get a parking coupon as there is no off strett parking otherwise a beautiful place to unwind.
